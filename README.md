# PRTG Scheduler

As the conversion to ruby has unfortunately has been canclled, here's what has been developed so far. It basically does not much yet, but it's a start. It uses [Ice_Cube](https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube) for reccuring event parsing and some other ruby gems which are installed automatically at the first run. I tried to make comments as verbose as possible. Feel free to fork it and finish it. In case you need to use it desperately, version 1 of the master branch should actually still work to a certain extend.
